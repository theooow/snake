# Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game in Java.

## Description

This game allows the player to control a snake on a grid. The snake moves in four directions (up, down, left, and right) and its goal is to eat apples that randomly appear on the grid. Each time the snake eats an apple, it grows longer. The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or with its own body.

## Features
