# Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game in Java.

## Description

This game allows the player to control a snake on a grid. The snake moves in four directions (up, down, left, and right) and its goal is to eat apples that randomly appear on the grid. Each time the snake eats an apple, it grows longer. The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or with its own body.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive controls
- Randomly generated apples
- Score tracking

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- IDE or text editor for Java development

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/theooow/snake.git
```


2. Open the project in your Java IDE or text editor.

3. Build the project.

4. Run the `App` class to start the game.

## Usage

- Use the arrow keys to control the snake's direction.
- Try to eat as many apples as possible without colliding with the walls or your own body.
- The score is displayed at the top of the game window.

## Bugs

- The snake can sometimes move on the hidden borders of the grid. This is due to the offset which permit the fluidity of the snake's movement.
